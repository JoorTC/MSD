This repository contains the Python-based machine learning model developed as part of the study titled:
"Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model for Accurate Detection of Wrong Blood in Tube Errors in Hospitalized Patients."

The model, built using the XGBoost algorithm, was trained on real-world clinical data from hospitalized patients to detect wrong blood in tube errors (WBIT), including:

- WBIT: confirmed errors (25%) and randomly simulated sample reorderings (25%)

- Properly identified control samples: 50%

This package was specifically designed for integration into a Clinical Decision Support System (CDS), with the goal of automating the detection of analytical inconsistencies and enhancing patient safety within routine clinical workflows.

Repository contents:

- Training dataset

- Script to train the model

- Brief documentation for implementation

This repository is part of the technical supplementary material associated with the manuscript and is provided to support transparency, reproducibility, and practical deployment.
