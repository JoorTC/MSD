missedSampleLib is a Python-based machine learning model developed as part of the study “Development and Validation of a CDS-Based Machine Learning Model for Accurate Detection of Wrong Blood in Tube (WBIT) Errors in Hospitalized Patients.”
It enables the automated detection of WBIT events in hospitalized patients. Built with XGBoost and trained on real-world data (50% correct samples, 25% confirmed WBIT, and 25% simulated reorderings), the model showed excellent performance in two independent external validations.
Input: Normalized variation of analytical parameters (relative to a previous sample within a 5-day window), in the following order:
MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, MPV, HGB, Cl⁻, Ht, K⁺, Cr, PLT, LYMPH, EO, RBC, Na⁺, BASO.
Output: Probability (0–1) of a WBIT event, recalibrated by default to 5% prevalence, adjustable via pi_target for local epidemiology.
Integrates seamlessly into CDSS/LIS environments for real-time automated error detection.
